# Cryptocurrencies-Trend-Analysis
The following repository is part of an academic project aiming at analysing cryptocurrencies price trends


The final submit consists in a Shiny App (see folder CryptocurrenciesTrendAnalysis, file "app")
which displays the dynamic graph of historical open prices (in $) of a chosen cryptocurrency (in a list)
and a description of the given cryptocurrency.

The data for the graph is extracted from thethe Poloniex.com API while the description is webscrapped on coinpedia.org.

While the first idea of the project was to potentially analyse hundreds of cryptocurrencies and understand price patterns,
due to a lack of time I decided to first try to do a small visualizer with up-to-date data.

The work consists in the App in itself, a first "Introduction" file explaining the different datasources found, and two test "files"
where different functions where built and tested before being implemented inside the app.
